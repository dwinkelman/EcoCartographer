Made stoplights assign properly to pts. This involves checking through eind first, and assigning any intersections stoplights if they are close. If there are no intersections, all points on the map within 0.0002 degrees are assigned a stoplight. Then, consecutive stoplights are trimmed down to one. This information is more accurately carried over into the instructions display. Finished on 8:55 PM 2/24/2015. Made markers for the instructions on the output.
