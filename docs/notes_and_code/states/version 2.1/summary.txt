Made elevation requests for every point, instead of one query. Still need to calibrate time between requests and size of requests. Noticed from experimentation that the optimal is about 300 pts @ 2000 ms, with ceiling for pts @ 350. Originally used XMLHttpRequest, but "No-access-control-origin" error kept occuring, so stuck with the Maps API method. This was tried first, but is was too slow, so I decided to try XML.
