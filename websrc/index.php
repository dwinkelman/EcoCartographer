    <h1>How it works</h1>
    <p>
     The user first enters the start and end locations along with their vehicle model. Next the program uses a formula to generate a list of possible routes. Then a filter is used to filter out similar routes. The top routes are then chosen from those routes. Lastly another filter is used which calculates the fuel efficiencies accurately and then chooses the top routes to display on the map.
